# TACTful Lies

## Description

A digital version of the classic two truths and one lie game. Users will be able to play a game where there will be a random selection of people that will have three options to choose from. One of these options will be a lie that has been randomly generated from a list of lies while the other two will be two truths that a user has entered about the person. After a predetermined number of rounds the game will end and display how many rounds the user got correct. Then they will be able to replay the game with another random set of people to begin the game again.  There will be a function to log in allowing the user to create new data entries for a wider selection for the game to choose from.
